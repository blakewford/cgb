------- Monday May 11, 2020  -------

1998 to 2001 or so I was working at Left Field Productions in Westlake Village,
California doing color gameboy programming. I was co-developer on:

Kobe Bryant 3 on 3
Beauty And The Beast: A Boardgame Adventure

I was sole developer on:
Little Mermaid II Pinball Frenzy
Thrillride Pinball

There was some interest in archiving source and data for these ancient gaming
machines so I dug it out and got it all to build on a modern recent linux
OS (I use ubuntu 18.04 LTS).

You'd just do

make

in this directory and hopefully everything will build.
The emulator I wrote is in the mgb/ directory and it uses SDL 1.x. If you do

make play

in this directory after a successful build it should launch the emulator with
the merm.gb image.


The keyboard keys are tuned for the pinball game.

Left + Right shift are flippers
A is start
Arrow keys do something
Z does something (push the table right)
/ does something (push the table left)
space does something (push the table up)
v does something, like go back

The emulator was used for development, it's much more convenient than an
actual color gameboy.


macOS compilation requirements:

Run this in any macOS terminal:

````
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lpla/homebrew-core/patch-1/Formula/sdl.rb --HEAD
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lunaczp/1a2ee039ec36361a732e079037b08874/raw/74bbae0ddbe2e387eca077eb1af24dbafa374529/elf.h > /usr/local/include/elf.h
```

Windows compilation notes:

It is tested to compile using msys2 + mingw64. You need to install msys2 and then run:

```
pacman -Syu
#Restart the msys2 window
pacman -Su

pacman -S gcc
pacman -S make
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
````

The issue here is that "sys/*" imports are only available in the msys2 gcc and SDL is only in the mingw64 gcc. So you need one window with the msys2 environment and another with the mingw64 one.

Start compiling with 'make' in the mingw64 window and once it crashes requesting a 'sys/*' library or showing a compatibility error, run 'make' in the msys2 window. Once SDL is requested again or another compatibility error comes up, go back to the mingw64 windows to finish compilation with 'make' again.


********* LITTLE MERMAID II PINBALL FRENZY *********

After build to run do:
make play

Then 'g' to go within the emulator

There was a USA version that included 5 languages, and a Japanese version
that had just english and japanese languages. The US version had a rumble pack
but didn't support the gameboy printer. The Japanese version had no
rumble pack but it did support the gameboy printer.

The source copy I have is closer to the Japanese version and the build
result merm.gb doesn't byte for byte match the released USA version, which
is readily available on rom download sites. I spent some time trying to
get the output to match but it's hopeless. I should have archived the code
associated with the final USA release so I could always rebuild it... but
oh well.

The gameplay is the same. Some of the artwork changed between the two versions
and the font data changed and there is the rumble/printer difference already
mentioned.

********* Beauty And The Beast: A Boardgame Adventure *********

After build to run do:
make play2

Then 'g' to go within the emulator

The gb/bb is source to this. This also seems to be closer to the Japanese
version of the game.

********* Thrillride Pinball *********

After build to run do:
make play3

Then 'g' to go within the emulator

The gb/thrill is source to this. The rom binary seems to byte for byte match
the released version of the game, which is nice for once.
